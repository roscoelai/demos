# Six Boxes (Part 1)

## Notes

- 6 identical boxes near the middle of the screen
- Highlight box on mouse-over
- Show picture on first click
- Start timer with first picture
- Delay for 3 seconds before moving to the side
- Subsequent clicks on a clicked box will show a blank (white box with a red cross)
- Also delay for 3 seconds before disappearing
- Timer ends when the last unclicked box is clicked
    - The 3 second delay will still be there, but not counted in the time taken
- There is a very inconspicuous timer near the bottom-right
    - For sanity checks, and can be disabled
- More data recorded now:
    - Order of boxes clicked
    - Times when boxes were clicked (w.r.t. first box clicked)
    - Number of erroneous clicks (per box)
    - Time taken
